- **PHP 7.3+** (default config with MySQL support)
- **Apache 2.4+** (default config with PHP support)

[Install](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) **WAMP Server 3.2+** for a ready-to-use database and localhost service



## Get eQual

- https://github.com/cedricfrancoys/equal-framework > Download code as ZIP, or clone with Git
