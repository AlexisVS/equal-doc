# Debugging



To help you with human-readable data, eQual comes with its own console (which simply reads the **qn_error.log** file in /log)

> Note: qn_error.log gets loads of information for each occuring event, so don't forget to delete that file from time to time if you don't want to end up with a few unused Mo of old logs. Especially if you're running a lot of tests

To access it from the browser:

```
http://your-localhost-path/console.php
```
