## Introduction

Controllers allow to attach an URI to any action  involving data manipulation or to a data providers.

They can also act as data funnels and dispatchers.

Controllers are re-usable and can be interdependent.

eQual controllers are stored inside the `actions`, `data` & `apps` folders. 

They are separated because they can achieve different kinds of operation/action's.

| **FOLDER**  | **OPERATION**                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Actions** | **"DO"** operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).              |
| **Data**    | **"GET"** operations (GET).                                  |
| **Apps**    | **"SHOW"** operations (for apps with UI generated by the back-end). |



## Announcement

	-  what it does
  -  expected parameters and related characteristics
  -  constraints, default value, optional or mandatory; type; name; description
- dependency injection services required by the script
- response format : content-type and content-disposition (charset)
- CORS : accept-origin (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

### description

Describes what the controller does.

### params

Array containing values used by the controller, which may be required.

### constants

List of strings, representing constant names, used by the system.

They are present globally inside the `config/config.inc.php` file, but also can be overwritten (with the **namespace config**) inside packages with a `config.inc.php` file.

Every overwritten constant is limited to the package it belongs to.

If they are used by a controller, they must be listed by it. If there is an error, displays `Error 500`.

Example :

``` php
'constants'     => ['AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_VALIDITY', 'AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY',
               		'AUTH_TOKEN_HTTPS']    
```

The constants are checked by the `announce()` function inside `eq.lib.php`.

### access

The access property allows to quickly define rights management: making sure the user performing a request has the required permissions.


| **PROPERTY** | **DESCRIPTION**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| visibility   | The level of "visibility" of the ('public', 'protected' or 'private'). |
| groups       | An array holding the list of groups the view is restricted to. |



Examples : 


```php
<?php
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'public'					
   // anyone can access the controller (anonymous users)
]
```

```php
<?php
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'protected',
  'users'       => [ROOT_USER_ID],           // list of granted users ids  
]
```

```php
<?php
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'protected',
  'groups'      => ['sales.bookings.users'], // list of granted groups names
]
```

### response

The response property provides info about the format of the returned data (if any).

It also allows to restrict the accepted origins of the requests (using CORS). At the moment the origin is unlimited, it is possible to create an array with the URL allowed to access the API.

```php
<?php
'response' => [
  'content-type'    => 'application/json',
  'charset'         => 'utf-8',
  'accept-origin'   => '*'
],
```

### providers

List of the different providers/services needed by the controller.

Example: 

```php
<?php 
'providers'   => ['context', 'orm' , 'auth']     
 //'orm'= ObjectManager & 'auth'=AuthentificationManager
```
