## Introduction

Controllers allow to attach an URI to any action  involving data manipulation or to a data providers.

They can also acts as data funnels and dispatchers.

Controllers are re-usable and can be interdependent.

eQual controllers are stored inside the `actions`, `data` & `apps` folders. 

They are separated because they can achieve different kinds of operation/action's.

- Actions folder is intended for "DO" operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Data folder is intended for "GET" operations (GET)
- Apps folder is intended for "SHOW" operations (for apps with UI generated by the back-end)

### access

The access property allows to quickly define rights management: making sure the user performing a request has the required permissions


| property   | description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| visibility | The level of "visibility" of the ('public', 'protected' or 'private'). |
| groups     | An array holding the list of groups the view is restricted to. |



Examples : 


```
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'public'					// anyone can access the controller (anonymous users)
]
```

```
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'protected',
  'users'       => [ROOT_USER_ID],           // list of granted users ids  
]
```

```
'access' => [
  'visibility'  => 'protected',
  'groups'      => ['sales.bookings.users'], // list of granted groups names
]
```

### response

The response property provides info about the format of the returned data (if any).

It also allows to restrict the accepted origins of the requests (using CORS).

```
'response' => [
  'content-type'    => 'application/json',
  'charset'         => 'utf-8',
  'accept-origin'   => '*'
],
```
