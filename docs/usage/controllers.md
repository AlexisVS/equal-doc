## Introduction

Controllers are everywhere and refer to every action involving data manipulation.

They can acts as data funnels and dispatchers.

But they're also involved in rights management: making sure the user performing a request has the required permissions



Controllers are re-usable and can be interdependent.

eQual controllers are stored inside the `actions`, `data` & `apps` folders. 

They are separated because they can achieve different kinds of operation/action's.

- Actions folder is intended for "DO" operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Data folder is intended for "GET" operations (GET)
- Apps folder is intended for "SHOW" operations (for apps with UI generated by the back-end)
