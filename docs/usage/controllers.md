## Introduction

Controllers are everywhere and refer to every action involving data manipulation.

They mainly play the role of data funnels and dispatchers.

But they're also involved in rights management: making sure the user performing a request has the required permissions



The Developer can create as many custom controllers as necessary.

Controllers are re-usable and can be inter-dependant.

eQual's controllers can be found inside the "Actions", "data" & "Apps" folders. 

They are separated because they can achieve different kinds of operation/action's.

- Action's folder => "DO" operation (post, put/patch, delete)
- Data's folder =>"GET" operation
- APP's folder => "SHOW" operation
