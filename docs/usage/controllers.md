## Introduction

Controllers are everywhere and refer to every action involving data manipulation.

They mainly play the role of data funnels and dispatchers.

But they're also involved in rights management: making sure the user performing a request has the required permissions



Developer can create as many custom controllers as necessary.

Controllers are re-usable and can be inter-dependant.
